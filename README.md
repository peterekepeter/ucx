Provides language support for UT99 unreal script. Is it a VsCode extension? 
Or does it extend the language itself? The answer is YES!

## Installation

> ðŸš§ Work in progress. Many features are still experimental! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

 - VsCode/Codium extension available
    - [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/peterekepeter/ucx)
